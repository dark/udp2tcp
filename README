-- Readme for udp2tcp --
------------------------

Summary
=========================

udp2tcp is a small but versatile tool aimed at forward UDP datagrams over TCP,
i.e., translate protocols to their TCP counterparts (DNS is a good example).
Useful when the service you are looking for is listening also on TCP also 
and your firewall mercilessly drops UDP datagrams.
